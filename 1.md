1. Data Sources & Integration

  - Where should Social Security benefit data come from?
    - Should we calculate benefits from scratch using SSA formulas? for each user they should have given us their FRA when creating Social SEcurity income in teh create scenario section.
    - Do you have existing Social Security data in the current scenario model? YES see above
    - Should we integrate with the existing SocialSecurityOverviewTab data? YEs

  2. Real-time Calculations

  - How should slider changes trigger updates?
    - Real-time as user drags (could be performance intensive) 
    - On slider release (debounced) 
    - On "Apply Changes" button click only: This option

  3. Social Security Formulas

  - Which calculations should we implement?
    - Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) calculations
    - Early/delayed retirement adjustments
    - Spousal benefits and survivor benefits
    - Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA)
  - Do you have preferred Social Security calculation libraries or should I build from scratch?
can you find the industry standard ones if not we can creatae our own
  4. IRMAA Integration: Yes based on TOTAL MAGI in the scenarion we need to have an option to see ss benefits with and without IRMAA.
  - How should IRMAA impact be calculated?
    - Pull from existing income projections in the scenario: yes
    - Use Medicare IRMAA brackets based on MAGI: yes
    - Should this affect the "net" Social Security benefit display?:yes but allow to see benefits with and without IRMAA reduction

  5. Optimization Algorithm

  - What should "Snap to Optimal" optimize for? REMOVE FOR NOW
    - Maximum lifetime benefits (considering life expectancy)
    - Best break-even scenario
    - Minimize taxes (considering other income)
    - Maximize survivor benefits

  6. Backend Integration

  - How should claiming strategies be saved?
    - New fields in the existing scenario model? yes
    - Separate Social Security strategy table?
    - Should this affect the overall scenario calculations? no this is just for modeling purposes

  7. Chart Visualizations

  - Lifetime Benefits Chart should show:
    - Cumulative benefits over time? yes
    - Monthly benefits over time? yes
    - Multiple scenarios comparison? not sure how this would work
    - Break-even point highlighting? yes
  - Retirement Paycheck Heat Map (for couples):
    - Combined monthly Social Security benefits? yes
    - Include IRMAA adjustments in the heat map? yes
    - Color coding strategy (green=optimal, red=poor)? yes

  8. Data Flow Architecture

  Current Flow Ideas:
  User adjusts sliders → Component calculates benefits → Updates visualizations
                                      ↓
                               Optionally saves to backend
                                      ↓
                            Updates overall scenario calculations

  My Recommendations:

  1. Start with frontend-only calculations using Social Security formulas
  2. Implement real-time updates with 300ms debouncing
  3. Use Chart.js for both lifetime benefits and heat map visualizations
  4. Create a Social Security service to encapsulate benefit calculations
  5. Save claiming strategies as new fields in the scenario model

  Questions for You:

  1. What's your priority order for these features?
  2. Do you have existing Social Security calculation logic I should leverage? please chack we can calculate benefit rom FRA
  3. Should this replace or complement the current Social Security tab? separate for now in teh future we may remove the other one
  4. Any specific Social Security rules or edge cases I should be aware of? not as of right now
  5. What level of accuracy do you need for the benefit calculations? pretty close to 100% based on the data we have

  What aspects would you like to tackle first, and do you have any preferences on the implementation approach?
