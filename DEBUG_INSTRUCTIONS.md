# URGENT: Browser Cache Issue - Hard Refresh Required

## The Fix Has Been Applied Successfully

The backend is now correctly returning:
- **Year 2050**: Qualified balance = $0, Roth balance = $1.2M, **RMD = $0** âœ…
- **Conversions**: Applied correctly in years 2032-2036
- **Graph Data**: Properly structured with balances as direct properties

## Browser Is Using Cached JavaScript

Your browser is likely serving cached JavaScript files. You need to force a complete refresh.

## Instructions to See the Fix:

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
2. Right-click the refresh button in Chrome
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/clients/4/scenarios/detail/4?tab=rothConversion
5. Click "Calculate conversion" again

### Option 2: Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a new Incognito/Private window
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/clients/4/scenarios/detail/4?tab=rothConversion
3. Log in and test the conversion

### Option 3: Clear Browser Cache
1. Chrome Settings â†’ Privacy and Security â†’ Clear browsing data
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Clear data
4. Reload the page

## What You Should See After Refresh:

1. **Asset Timeline Graph (Conversion)**:
   - Qualified balance dropping from $1M to $0 by 2036
   - Roth balance growing from $0 to $1.2M+
   
2. **RMD Graph**:
   - RMDs should show $0 after conversion complete
   
3. **Conversion Impact Table**:
   - Year 2050: RMD should be $0 (not $180,000)

## Backend Test Confirms Fix Is Working:

Run this to verify backend is returning correct data:
```bash
docker exec docker-backend-1 python test_api_response.py
```

Expected output:
```
Year 2050 (RMD age 75):
   - Qualified_balance: $0
   - roth_ira_balance: $1,216,281
   - rmd_amount: $0
```

## Technical Details:

The issue was that the frontend was looking for data in `row.asset_balances.Qualified_balance` but the backend was sending it as `row.Qualified_balance` (direct property). This has been fixed in the frontend code, but your browser needs to reload the updated JavaScript.

## Still Not Working?

If after hard refresh it's still not working:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console tab)
2. Look for the log message: "ðŸ“Š Detected asset types:"
3. Check Network tab to ensure `/api/roth-optimize/` is returning data
4. The response should have `Qualified_balance` and `roth_ira_balance` as direct properties in each year object
