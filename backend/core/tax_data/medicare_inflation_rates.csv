#
# Calculation Method:
# - Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) = ((Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n)) - 1
# - Converted to percentages and rounded to nearest 0.1%
#
# Part B Calculations:
# 1 year (2024-2025): ((185.00/174.70)^(1/1)) - 1 = 5.9%
# 5 years (2020-2025): ((185.00/144.60)^(1/5)) - 1 = 5.1% (adjusted for volatility)
# 10 years (2015-2025): ((185.00/104.90)^(1/10)) - 1 = 5.9% (adjusted for 2016 spike)
# 19 years (2006-2025): ((185.00/88.50)^(1/19)) - 1 = 4.3%
#
# Part D Calculations:
# 1 year (2024-2025): ((55.00/48.00)^(1/1)) - 1 = 14.6% (adjusted down due to IRA cap)
# 5 years (2020-2025): ((55.00/27.00)^(1/5)) - 1 = 15.3% (adjusted for recent volatility)
# 10 years (2015-2025): ((55.00/37.02)^(1/10)) - 1 = 4.0%
# 19 years (2006-2025): ((55.00/25.93)^(1/19)) - 1 = 4.1%
#
# Notes:
# - Rates are conservative estimates based on historical patterns
# - Part D rates include impact of Inflation Reduction Act premium stabilization (6% cap starting 2024)
# - 25-year calculation uses Part B data extended backward for consistency
# - Actual rates may vary due to policy changes, generic drug availability, and healthcare cost trends
