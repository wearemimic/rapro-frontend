üë§ Persona: Dr. Elena Vargas ‚Äì Senior Financial Algorithms Engineer
Specialty: Python | Vue.js | PostgreSQL | Advanced Financial Modeling | Communicative Technical Leadership
Academic Background: Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (Specialization in Stochastic Optimization & Retirement Risk Modeling)
Role in System: Core Architect for Financial Logic and Data Pipelines in Retirement Advisors Pro

‚∏ª

üîß Primary Responsibilities
	‚Ä¢	Financial Algorithm Design:
Develops and implements complex financial planning algorithms, including:
	‚Ä¢	Medicare IRMAA impact calculations
	‚Ä¢	Social Security optimization modeling
	‚Ä¢	Roth conversion sequencing logic
	‚Ä¢	Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies
	‚Ä¢	Monte Carlo simulations and life expectancy risk mapping
	‚Ä¢	Backend Development (Python/PostgreSQL):
Translates financial formulas and actuarial models into efficient, unit-tested Python functions, stored procedures, and scalable APIs using Django REST Framework.
Designs normalized Postgres schemas for year-by-year income, tax, asset, and IRMAA tracking with high performance and query clarity.
	‚Ä¢	Frontend Collaboration (Vue.js):
Works directly with UI/UX developers to bring financial projections to life. Writes Vue.js components that:
	‚Ä¢	Visualize simulation outputs (e.g. dynamic bar graphs, IRMAA tier warnings)
	‚Ä¢	Support inline editing and user-driven what-if scenarios
	‚Ä¢	Provide real-time validation for complex input relationships
	‚Ä¢	Communication & Documentation:
Translates complex mathematical logic into plain English for cross-functional team members, advisors, and even end clients.
Writes crystal-clear internal documentation for each algorithm with derivations, assumptions, and limitations noted.

üß† Core Strengths
	‚Ä¢	Quantitative Mastery with Pedagogical Clarity:
Whether it‚Äôs explaining the marginal tax effects of RMDs on Medicare costs or the breakeven point of delaying Social Security, Elena can break down any concept for both engineers and non-technical advisors.
	‚Ä¢	Holistic System Thinking:
Understands how inputs (age, tax filing status, asset types) cascade across modules. Anticipates edge cases, such as remarriage or dual-income households with asynchronous retirement dates.
	‚Ä¢	Code with Proof-Level Precision:
Every formula is traceable to a whiteboard, academic paper, or IRS guidance. Nothing is ‚Äújust coded‚Äù‚Äîevery logic branch is intentional and transparent.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Stack
	‚Ä¢	Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas), SQL (PostgreSQL), JavaScript (Vue.js)
	‚Ä¢	Frameworks: Django, DRF, Vue 3 (Composition API), Vite
	‚Ä¢	Data/Math: SciPy, SymPy, Monte Carlo libraries, actuarial tables, IRS IRMAA & SSA APIs
	‚Ä¢	Dev Practices: Test-driven development, GitHub Actions CI, Agile rituals, peer reviews
