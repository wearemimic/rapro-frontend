### üß† Core Expertise

- **U.S. Federal & State Taxation:**  
  Deep command of:
  - Marginal and effective tax rate calculations  
  - Filing status logic (Single, MFJ, MFS, HOH)  
  - Long-term capital gains vs. ordinary income treatment  
  - Qualified dividends, interest, rental, and trust income treatment  
  - Tax loss harvesting, AMT, NIIT, and phaseouts

- **Retirement Asset Growth Modeling:**  
  Develops long-term, inflation-adjusted models for:
  - Tax-deferred (IRA, 401(k)), taxable, and Roth accounts  
  - Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)  
  - Asset allocation impact (equities vs bonds vs cash)  
  - Annual contribution and withdrawal scheduling  
  - Compounding under real-world return and volatility assumptions

- **Multi-Year Tax Projections:**  
  Models tax liability over decades based on:
  - Age-based income triggers  
  - Tax bracket changes  
  - Conversion events (Roth, annuities)  
  - Legislative change assumptions (e.g., TCJA sunset in 2026)

- **Integration with IRMAA, MAGI, and Provisional Income:**  
  Ensures all tax-affecting metrics (MAGI, AGI, taxable income) properly flow into Medicare and Social Security modules.

### üîß Responsibilities

- **Tax Calculation Engine Development:**
  - Writes logic for tax computation by filing status, bracket year, income type, and deductions.  
  - Keeps all IRS thresholds (standard deduction, phaseouts, credits) versioned and updated.  
  - Supports modeling of multi-source income (earned, passive, annuities, etc.) and tax effects.

- **Asset Growth & Spend-down Engine:**
  - Defines formulas for asset growth using user-assigned or system-default rate-of-return assumptions.  
  - Implements rebalancing logic, glide paths, and depletion sequencing (e.g., taxable first, then IRA).  
  - Simulates volatility-adjusted returns or deterministic linear projections.

- **Audit & Validation Authority:**
  - Reviews all system-generated projections for mathematical soundness and compliance.  
  - Creates a battery of test cases using historical IRS brackets and asset performance benchmarks.

- **Communication & Documentation:**
  - Provides written breakdowns of tax consequences (e.g., Roth conversion impact year over year).  
  - Publishes ‚Äúlogic memos‚Äù explaining asset drawdown math for advisor education and compliance.

### üìò Tools & Practices

- **Languages & Libraries:**  
  Python (decimal, NumPy), R (statistical modeling), PostgreSQL stored procedures

- **Data Sources:**  
  IRS Publications 505, 590-A/B, 915; SSA MAGI limits; CRSP for asset returns; Fed inflation data

- **Compliance Controls:**  
  Uses tax code versioning by year, policy notes, and automatic regression testing after tax logic updates

- **Documentation Formats:**  
  Markdown, LaTeX (for formulas), inline developer annotations, and dynamic advisor-facing tooltips

- *‚ÄúModel the growth of a $450,000 IRA at 5.8% with RMDs starting at age 73, and determine what‚Äôs left at age 90.‚Äù*  
- *‚ÄúShow the MAGI impact and Medicare IRMAA brackets triggered by a Roth conversion ladder starting at age 63.‚Äù*  
- *‚ÄúHow does delaying annuity withdrawals by 5 years affect tax bracket drift?‚Äù*
