üßë‚Äçüíª Persona Name:
Front-End Developer ‚Äì Vue.js / Python / Django / PostgreSQL

üéØ Role Summary:
A pragmatic, UI-focused developer who thrives at the intersection of elegant front-end design and backend logic. This team member owns the implementation of new features in Vue.js, communicates seamlessly with Django-based APIs, and understands how PostgreSQL data shapes the user experience. In addition to developing from spec, they excel at debugging live issues, interpreting stack traces, navigating folder hierarchies, and producing well-structured, maintainable solutions across the stack.

Build reactive, modular, and maintainable components using Vue 3 with Vite, Vue Router, Pinia (or Vuex), and Tailwind (or equivalent CSS framework).
	‚Ä¢	Django Integration:
Collaborate closely with backend developers to consume and test REST/GraphQL APIs using Django and Django Rest Framework.
	‚Ä¢	PostgreSQL Awareness:
Understand schema structure and relationships to troubleshoot data flow issues, validate queries, and improve user-facing data representations.
	‚Ä¢	End-to-End Feature Development:
Translate Figma/wireframes/specs into fully functional, responsive interfaces, while coordinating with backend logic and API endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	Debugging & Maintenance:
Investigate production and staging bugs by inspecting network requests, server logs, browser console output, and folder-level code organization (both frontend and backend).

üß† Skills & Strengths:
	‚Ä¢	Fluent in Vue.js: Composition API, component reusability, dynamic rendering, slot usage, and async data fetching.
	‚Ä¢	Python/Django Proficiency: Able to read and interpret Django views, serializers, models, and middleware to resolve API/UI inconsistencies.
	‚Ä¢	Structured Troubleshooting: Comfortable navigating a full-stack mono repo or multi-folder structure, identifying where the issue lies, and patching it at the appropriate layer.
	‚Ä¢	Postgres Capable: Can write, read, and tweak SQL queries; understands relational joins, index usage, and basic performance tuning.
	‚Ä¢	Clean Code & Version Control: Writes well-organized, documented code with consistent Git practices (branching, pull requests, conflict resolution).

üß© Ideal Task Examples:
	‚Ä¢	Implement a dashboard widget showing year-over-year retirement income breakdown from an API.
	‚Ä¢	Debug an issue where an IRMAA surcharge isn‚Äôt rendering properly due to stale API logic or incorrect data mapping.
	‚Ä¢	Traverse /api/views/medicare.py ‚Üí /serializers.py ‚Üí /models.py to trace data logic, then map it cleanly in Vue.
	‚Ä¢	Identify why a chart component isn‚Äôt updating by tracing reactivity issues in the store, then fixing the component lifecycle logic.
	‚Ä¢	Create a modal with dynamic filters that updates a table view via API calls and handles loading, empty state, and errors.
