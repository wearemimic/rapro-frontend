## üß© System Dependencies

- Full Calculation Engine (STEP 1-7)
- Roth Conversion Engine (STEP 6)
- Tax, Medicare, IRMAA, MAGI calculations
- Pre-loaded client scenario

## üîß Full UI Flow Specification

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Section 1 ‚Äî Asset Selection Panel

#### Display: Full List of Eligible Roth-Convertible Assets

| Asset | Owner | Value | Amount to Convert |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|
| IRA | Client | $X | [Input box] |
| 401k | Spouse | $Y | [Input box] |
| etc. | ... | ... | ... |

- Values preloaded from `core_incomesource` and scenario data.
- Editable input box for advisor to enter amount to convert from each account.
- Total amount requested cannot exceed available balance.
- Show running total of selected amounts.

#### Validation:

- Disable over-allocation (cannot input more than balance).
- Display warnings if total conversion exceeds balances.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Section 2 ‚Äî Conversion Schedule Parameters

#### Input Fields:

- ‚úÖ **Projected Pre-Retirement Household Income:** (Pre-filled from scenario income engine; editable override field.)
- ‚úÖ **Conversion Start Year (or Age Selector):**  
  - Year dropdown based on both Client and Spouse.
  - Optional Age-Based picker (auto-translates to year).
- ‚úÖ **Years to Convert (Slider):**  
  - Slider: 0 ‚Üí 10 years (can be expanded for future versions).
  - If slider = 0, no conversion table generated.
- ‚úÖ **Roth Growth Rate:**  
  - Editable input, default from scenario assumptions.
- ‚úÖ **Age to Begin Roth Withdrawals (optional field for future phases):**
- ‚úÖ **Monthly Roth Withdrawal (optional field for future phases):**

#### Logic:

- Once advisor selects start year and number of years, system calculates even distribution:

```python
Annual_Conversion = Total_Amount_Selected / Years_Selected
```

- Auto-update downstream tables in real-time.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Section 3 ‚Äî Conversion Impact Table (Dynamic)

#### Table Columns:

| Year | Client/Spouse Ages | Income Before Conversion | Conversion Amount | Total Taxable Income | Tax Bracket (%) | Federal Tax | Medicare Costs |
|------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|

#### Calculation Notes:

- **Income Before Conversion:** pulled from existing Scenario Engine (STEP 3) per year.
- **Conversion Amount:** equal allocation across selected years.
- **Total Taxable Income:** pre-conversion income + Roth conversion for year.
- **Tax Bracket and Federal Tax:** full engine tax calculation applied.
- **Medicare Costs (including IRMAA):** applied with 2-year lookback.

#### Updates:

- Table fully recalculates live as advisor adjusts schedule.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Section 4 ‚Äî Baseline vs Roth Conversion Comparison Table

| Metric | Baseline | Roth Conversion |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Lifetime Federal Taxes | $ |
| Lifetime Medicare Premiums | $ |
| Lifetime IRMAA Surcharges | $ |
| Net Lifetime Spendable Income | $ |
| Final Roth IRA Balance | $ |
| Total Net Assets at Mortality | $ |
| Average IRMAA Tier Hit | Tier Level |

#### Logic:

- Baseline = scenario run without Roth conversions.
- Roth Conversion = scenario run with manual Roth inputs applied.
- Both scenarios run through full engine for full projection.

#### Display:

- Auto-updated side-by-side comparison presented after advisor completes Roth inputs.
- Include short helper text for advisor:  
  > "This summary compares your proposed Roth conversion against your client's baseline scenario, including full tax and Medicare impacts."
