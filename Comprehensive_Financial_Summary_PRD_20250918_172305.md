# PRD: Comprehensive Financial Summary Table for RetirementAdvisorPro
**Created: September 18, 2025, 5:23:05 PM**

## Executive Summary
Create a comprehensive year-by-year financial projection table that displays all income sources, asset balances, tax calculations, Medicare costs, and net income for retirement scenarios. This table will serve as the single source of truth for all financial data, with individual scenario views selecting which columns to display.

## Business Requirements

### Objective
Provide CPAs and financial advisors with a complete, auditable view of:
- Every income source and asset by year
- Tax calculations (federal and state)
- Medicare costs including IRMAA surcharges
- RMD calculations following IRS rules
- Net income after all deductions

### Success Criteria
- CPAs can review without questions about calculations
- All IRS rules correctly implemented
- Every dollar accounted for and traceable
- No hardcoded values - all configurable via CSV

## Technical Architecture

### New Processing Module
**File**: `/backend/core/comprehensive_calculator.py`

This module will:
1. Load all IncomeSource records for a scenario
2. Calculate year-by-year projections from retirement to mortality
3. Apply IRS rules for each asset type
4. Return complete financial data for every year

### Data Flow
```
IncomeSource Table → Comprehensive Calculator → API Endpoint → Frontend Table
                            ↑                        ↑
                     Tax CSVs (IRS rules)    IRMAA CSVs (Medicare)
```

## Detailed Specifications

### 1. Data Collection Phase

#### 1.1 Load Income Sources
```python
def load_scenario_data(scenario_id):
    """
    Returns all IncomeSource records grouped by type:
    - social_security: [{id, owner, monthly_amount, start_age, cola, ...}]
    - qualified_assets: [{id, owner, balance, withdrawal, rmd_rules, ...}]
    - non_qualified_assets: [{id, owner, balance, withdrawal, ...}]
    - roth_assets: [{id, owner, balance, withdrawal, ...}]
    - inherited_assets: [{id, type, owner, special_rules, ...}]
    - other_income: [{pension, rental, wages, annuity, ...}]
    """
```

#### 1.2 Income Type Classification
- **Social Security**: `income_type = "social_security"`
- **Qualified Assets** (subject to RMDs):
  - `"Qualified"`
  - `"Inherited Traditional Spouse"`
  - `"Inherited Traditional Non-Spouse"`
- **Non-Qualified Assets**: `"Non-Qualified"`
- **Roth Assets**:
  - `"Roth"` (no RMDs during owner's lifetime)
  - `"Inherited Roth Spouse"`
  - `"Inherited Roth Non-Spouse"` (has RMDs!)
- **Other Income**: `"pension"`, `"rental_income"`, `"wages"`, `"annuity"`, `"reverse_mortgage"`

### 2. Calculation Engine

#### 2.1 Year-by-Year Processing
```python
def calculate_comprehensive_projection(scenario):
    """
    For each year from retirement_year to last_mortality_year:
    1. Calculate age for primary and spouse
    2. Process each income source
    3. Process each asset (withdrawals/RMDs)
    4. Calculate taxes
    5. Calculate Medicare/IRMAA
    6. Calculate net income
    """
```

#### 2.2 RMD Calculation Rules

**RMD Start Ages by Asset Type:**
- **Qualified (Traditional)**: Age 73 (75 for birth year 1960+)
- **Inherited Traditional Spouse**: Can treat as own (age 73) or use life expectancy
- **Inherited Traditional Non-Spouse**: Must start immediately, 10-year rule
- **Roth**: No RMDs during owner's lifetime
- **Inherited Roth Spouse**: Can treat as own (no RMDs) or use life expectancy
- **Inherited Roth Non-Spouse**: Must take RMDs, 10-year rule

**RMD Calculation Formula:**
```python
def calculate_rmd(asset, year, age):
    if not requires_rmd(asset, age):
        return 0

    # Use IRS Uniform Lifetime Table
    divisor = RMD_TABLE[age]  # e.g., age 73 = 26.5
    rmd = asset.previous_year_balance / divisor

    # Take greater of RMD or planned withdrawal
    withdrawal = max(rmd, asset.monthly_amount * 12)

    return min(withdrawal, asset.current_balance)
```

**IRS RMD Table** (Uniform Lifetime):
```python
RMD_TABLE = {
    72: 27.4, 73: 26.5, 74: 25.5, 75: 24.6, 76: 23.7,
    77: 22.9, 78: 22.0, 79: 21.1, 80: 20.2, 81: 19.4,
    82: 18.5, 83: 17.7, 84: 16.8, 85: 16.0, 86: 15.2,
    87: 14.4, 88: 13.7, 89: 12.9, 90: 12.2, ...
}
```

### 3. Income Processing

#### 3.1 Social Security
```python
def process_social_security(ss_asset, year, age):
    if age < ss_asset.age_to_begin_withdrawal:
        return 0

    years_since_start = age - ss_asset.age_to_begin_withdrawal
    cola_factor = (1 + ss_asset.cola) ** years_since_start
    annual_benefit = ss_asset.monthly_amount * 12 * cola_factor

    # Apply reductions if enabled (2030+ rules)
    if scenario.reduction_2030_ss and year >= 2030:
        annual_benefit *= (1 - reduction_percentage)

    return annual_benefit
```

#### 3.2 Investment Assets
```python
def process_investment_asset(asset, year, age):
    # Update balance with growth
    if age < asset.age_to_begin_withdrawal:
        asset.balance *= (1 + asset.rate_of_return)
        asset.balance += asset.monthly_contribution * 12
        return 0, asset.balance

    # Calculate withdrawal
    rmd = calculate_rmd(asset, year, age) if is_qualified(asset) else 0
    planned_withdrawal = asset.monthly_amount * 12
    actual_withdrawal = max(rmd, planned_withdrawal)

    # Update balance
    asset.balance -= actual_withdrawal
    asset.balance *= (1 + asset.rate_of_return)

    return actual_withdrawal, asset.balance
```

#### 3.3 Other Income Types
```python
def process_other_income(income, year, age):
    if age < income.age_to_begin_withdrawal or age > income.age_to_end_withdrawal:
        return 0

    # Apply COLA if applicable
    years = age - income.age_to_begin_withdrawal
    cola_factor = (1 + income.cola) ** years if income.cola else 1

    return income.monthly_amount * 12 * cola_factor
```

### 4. Tax Calculations

#### 4.1 AGI Calculation
```python
def calculate_agi(year_data):
    # Sum all income sources
    total_income = sum([
        year_data['ss_income'],
        year_data['qualified_withdrawals'],
        year_data['non_qualified_withdrawals'],
        year_data['pension_income'],
        year_data['rental_income'],
        year_data['wages'],
        year_data['other_income']
    ])

    # Calculate taxable Social Security
    provisional_income = (total_income - year_data['ss_income']) + (0.5 * year_data['ss_income'])
    taxable_ss = calculate_taxable_ss(provisional_income, filing_status)

    agi = total_income - year_data['ss_income'] + taxable_ss
    return agi
```

#### 4.2 Federal Tax (from CSV)
```python
def calculate_federal_tax(agi, filing_status, year):
    # Load from federal_tax_brackets_YYYY.csv
    brackets = load_federal_brackets(year, filing_status)
    standard_deduction = load_standard_deduction(year, filing_status)

    taxable_income = max(0, agi - standard_deduction)

    tax = 0
    for bracket in brackets:
        if taxable_income > bracket.min:
            taxable_in_bracket = min(taxable_income - bracket.min,
                                    bracket.max - bracket.min)
            tax += taxable_in_bracket * bracket.rate

    return tax, get_marginal_rate(taxable_income, brackets)
```

#### 4.3 State Tax (from CSV)
```python
def calculate_state_tax(agi, state, year):
    # Load from state_tax_rates_YYYY.csv
    state_info = load_state_tax_info(state, year)

    if state_info.retirement_income_exempt:
        return 0

    state_agi = agi
    if not state_info.taxes_ss:
        state_agi -= taxable_ss  # Remove SS from state taxable income

    return state_agi * state_info.tax_rate
```

### 5. Medicare/IRMAA Calculations

#### 5.1 IRMAA Brackets (from CSV)
```python
def calculate_irmaa(magi, filing_status, year):
    # Load from irmaa_thresholds_YYYY.csv
    brackets = load_irmaa_brackets(year, filing_status)

    # Apply 2-year lookback
    lookback_magi = get_magi_from_2_years_ago(year - 2)

    for bracket in brackets:
        if lookback_magi <= bracket.threshold:
            return {
                'bracket_number': bracket.number,
                'part_b_surcharge': bracket.part_b_surcharge,
                'part_d_surcharge': bracket.part_d_surcharge,
                'threshold': bracket.threshold
            }

    return highest_bracket
```

#### 5.2 Medicare Costs
```python
def calculate_medicare_costs(year, irmaa_bracket):
    # Load from medicare_costs_YYYY.csv
    base_costs = load_medicare_base_costs(year)

    return {
        'part_b': base_costs.part_b + irmaa_bracket.part_b_surcharge,
        'part_d': base_costs.part_d + irmaa_bracket.part_d_surcharge,

```

#### 8.2 Column Selection by View
Different scenario tabs will show different column subsets:
- **Income Tab**: All income sources, totals
- **Tax Tab**: AGI, taxes, rates
- **Medicare Tab**: IRMAA brackets, surcharges
- **Overview Tab**: Key summary columns only

### 9. Validation & Testing

#### 9.1 RMD Validation
- Verify RMDs start at correct age for each asset type
- Confirm RMD > planned withdrawal triggers RMD amount
- Test 10-year rule for inherited accounts
- Validate Roth accounts have no owner RMDs

#### 9.2 Tax Validation
- Cross-check with IRS tax tables
- Verify state tax exemptions
- Confirm Social Security taxation thresholds
- Test standard deduction application

#### 9.3 IRMAA Validation
- Verify 2-year lookback
- Test bracket thresholds
- Confirm surcharge amounts
- Validate Hold Harmless provisions

### 10. CSV Configuration Files

Required CSV files in `/backend/core/tax_data/`:
- `federal_tax_brackets_YYYY.csv`
- `federal_standard_deductions_YYYY.csv`
- `state_tax_rates_YYYY.csv`
- `irmaa_thresholds_YYYY.csv`
- `medicare_costs_YYYY.csv`
- `social_security_thresholds_YYYY.csv`

### 11. Error Handling

- Missing income sources: Continue with $0
- Invalid ages: Skip that year's income
- Balance < withdrawal: Take remaining balance
- Missing CSV data: Use previous year + inflation
- Division by zero: Return 0 with warning log

### 12. Performance Considerations

- Cache CSV data on module load
- Pre-calculate static values (COLA factors)
- Batch database queries
- Limit to 100 years maximum
- Return paginated results if needed
