# Enhancements

## 1. Update `start.sh` Script

- **Objective**: Modify the `start.sh` script to include a check for any running processes on a specified port before proceeding with the build.
- **Details**: This enhancement will help prevent port conflicts by ensuring that no other services are running on the required port before starting the build process. If a process is found running on the port, the script should prompt the user to stop the process or choose a different port.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Add a function in `start.sh` to check for running processes on the specified port using a command like `lsof -i :<port>`.
  2. If a process is found, output a message to the user indicating the conflict and provide options to resolve it.
  3. Proceed with the build only if the port is free or after the user resolves the conflict.

## 2. Show Graph for Masset Income

- **Objective**: When adding income, if it is a masset like a 401k, display a graph showing the spend down based on criteria and the amount left at death.
- **Details**: This enhancement will provide a visual representation of how the masset is spent over time, helping users understand the financial trajectory and remaining balance at the end of life.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Identify when the income source is a masset like a 401k during the income addition process.
  2. Calculate the spend down trajectory based on user-defined criteria.
  3. Display a graph under the income entry showing the spend down and the projected amount left at death.

## 3. Model Different Income Withdrawal Levels

- **Objective**: Allow users to specify different income withdrawal levels over time for accounts like Roth IRA.
- **Details**: This enhancement will enable users to model scenarios where they withdraw different amounts at different stages of retirement. For example, withdrawing $4,000 a month for the first 3 years, then $3,000 for the remainder of retirement.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Update the income modeling interface to allow users to specify multiple withdrawal levels and durations.
  2. Adjust the simulation engine to account for these varying withdrawal levels over the specified periods.
  3. Ensure the results reflect the impact of these changes on the overall retirement plan and account balances.

## 4. Analyze Wealthbox Clients for IRMAA Impact

- **Objective**: Use AI to analyze clients in Wealthbox and identify those who may be hitting IRMAA based on their assets.
- **Details**: This enhancement will leverage AI to automatically review client data in Wealthbox, assessing asset levels and predicting potential IRMAA impacts. This proactive approach helps advisors manage client expectations and plan accordingly.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Integrate Wealthbox API to access client data securely.
  2. Develop an AI model to analyze asset data and predict IRMAA impact.
  3. Provide a report or dashboard highlighting clients at risk of IRMAA, with recommendations for mitigation.
