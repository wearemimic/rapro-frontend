## Technical Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Admin Interface Architecture

**Recommended Approach**: Integrated Vue.js admin interface within existing application

**Rationale**:
- **Unified Authentication**: Same Auth0 login, no separate admin authentication
- **Single Application**: Admin routes integrated into existing Vue.js app
- **Consistent UX**: Same design system, navigation, and styling as main application
- **Shared State**: Admin and advisor features can interact seamlessly
- **Role-Based Access**: Dynamic UI based on user permissions
- **Simplified Deployment**: Single application to build, deploy, and maintain

**Integration Approach**:
- Admin routes added to existing Vue Router configuration
- Admin components follow same component structure and patterns
- Shared Pinia stores with admin-specific actions and getters
- Same Bootstrap/Front Dashboard theme and styling framework

**Alternative Considered**: Separate Admin Application
- Pros: Complete isolation, independent deployment
- Cons: Separate authentication, inconsistent UX, deployment complexity

### 2. Database Design

**Extend Existing Models**:

```python
# Extend existing CustomUser model (backend/core/models.py)
class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Add admin capabilities to existing model
    is_platform_admin = models.BooleanField(default=False, help_text="Can access admin area")
    admin_role = models.CharField(
        max_length=50, 
        choices=[
            ('super_admin', 'Super Administrator'),
            ('support_admin', 'Support Administrator'),
            ('billing_admin', 'Billing Administrator'),
            ('analytics_viewer', 'Analytics Viewer'),
        ],
        blank=True, null=True,
        help_text="Admin role determines permissions"
    )
    admin_permissions = models.JSONField(default=dict, help_text="Granular admin permissions")
    last_admin_access = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    
    @property
    def can_access_admin(self):
        """Check if user has admin access"""
        return self.is_platform_admin and self.admin_role
    
    @property
    def is_super_admin(self):
        """Check if user has super admin privileges"""
        return self.admin_role == 'super_admin'

class UserImpersonationLog(models.Model):
    admin_user = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    target_user = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='impersonations')
    session_start = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    session_end = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
    actions_performed = models.JSONField(default=list)

class SystemMetric(models.Model):
    metric_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    value = models.DecimalField(max_digits=15, decimal_places=2)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    metadata = models.JSONField(default=dict)

class SupportTicket(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=TICKET_STATUSES)
    priority = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=PRIORITY_CHOICES)
    assigned_to = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

          <i class="mdi mdi-view-dashboard"></i>
          <span>Dashboard</span>
        </router-link>
      </li>
      <!-- ... existing nav items ... -->
      
      <!-- Admin section (conditionally rendered) -->
      <li class="nav-header" v-if="userStore.canAccessAdmin">
        <span class="text-muted">ADMIN AREA</span>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item" v-if="userStore.canAccessAdmin">
        <router-link to="/admin" class="nav-link">
          <i class="mdi mdi-shield-crown text-warning"></i>
          <span>Admin Dashboard</span>
        </router-link>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item" v-if="userStore.hasPermission('user_management')">

      @row-action="handleUserAction"
    />
    
    <!-- Use existing Modal component -->
    <Modal
      v-model="showUserModal"
      title="Edit User"
      size="lg"
    >
      <!-- Use existing Form components -->
      <UserForm :user="selectedUser" @save="saveUser" />
    </Modal>
  </div>
</template>
```

**Style Classes Consistency**:
```scss
// Use existing utility classes and custom styles
.admin-dashboard {
  // Leverage existing dashboard styles
  @extend .main-dashboard;
  
  .stats-card {
    // Use existing card styling
    @extend .dashboard-card;
    
    .stats-icon {
      // Match existing icon styling
      @extend .dashboard-icon;
    }
  }
  
  .admin-badge {
    // New admin-specific elements follow existing patterns
    @extend .badge;
    background-color: var(--warning-color);
    color: var(--dark-color);
  }
}
```

### 5. Workflow Optimization

   - User communication via existing messaging system

**UI Consistency Examples**:
```vue
<!-- Admin forms follow existing patterns -->
<FormGroup label="User Role" required>
  <Select
    v-model="user.admin_role"
    :options="adminRoleOptions"
    placeholder="Select admin role"
  />
</FormGroup>

<!-- Admin tables use existing DataTable component -->
<DataTable
  :data="systemMetrics"
  :columns="metricsColumns"
  :loading="loading"
  class="admin-metrics-table"
/>

<!-- Admin modals follow existing Modal component -->
<Modal v-model="showImpersonateModal" title="Impersonate User">
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <i class="mdi mdi-alert mr-2"></i>
    This action will be logged for audit purposes.
  </div>
