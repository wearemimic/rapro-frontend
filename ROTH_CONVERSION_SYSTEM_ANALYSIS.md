## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. User Input Flow
```
User Interface → Asset Selection → Conversion Parameters → API Call
```

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  scenario: { /* scenario parameters */ },
  client: { /* client demographics */ },
  spouse: { /* spouse data if applicable */ },
  assets: [ /* asset array with conversion amounts */ ],
  optimizer_params: {
    conversion_start_year: 2025,
    years_to_convert: 5,
    max_annual_amount: 50000,
    pre_retirement_income: 80000,
    roth_growth_rate: 5.0,
    roth_withdrawal_amount: 2000,
    roth_withdrawal_start_year: 2035
  }
}
```

### 2. Backend Processing Flow
```
API Request → RothConversionProcessor → Baseline Scenario → Conversion Scenario → Comparison Analysis → Response
```

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Asset Preparation:** Creates synthetic Roth asset, validates conversion amounts
2. **Baseline Calculation:** Runs ScenarioProcessor with original assets (no conversion)
3. **Conversion Calculation:** Runs ScenarioProcessor with modified assets (includes conversion)
4. **Pre-retirement Handling:** Manually calculates pre-retirement years if conversion starts before retirement
5. **Metrics Extraction:** Calculates lifetime totals for taxes, Medicare, RMDs, inheritance tax
6. **Comparison Generation:** Produces difference and percentage change metrics

### 3. Response Structure
```javascript
{
  baseline_results: [ /* year-by-year baseline data */ ],
  conversion_results: [ /* year-by-year conversion data */ ],
  metrics: {
    baseline: { /* baseline totals */ },
    conversion: { /* conversion totals */ },
    comparison: { /* differences and percentages */ }
  },
  conversion_params: { /* echoed parameters */ },
  asset_balances: { /* visualization data */ },
  optimal_schedule: { /* conversion schedule summary */ }
}
```

## Mathematical Models and Calculations

### 1. RMD Calculation Logic

**Location:** `ScenarioProcessor._calculate_rmd()`

**Algorithm:**
```python
def _calculate_rmd(self, asset, year):
    # Check if asset type requires RMD
    if not self._requires_rmd(asset):  # Only "Qualified", "Inherited Traditional" types
        return 0
    
    # Age-based RMD start age determination
    rmd_start_age = self._get_rmd_start_age(asset, owner_birthdate)
    
    # Special handling for inherited non-spouse (10-year rule)
    if asset_type == "Inherited Traditional Non-Spouse":
        if years_since_inheritance >= 10:
            return entire_remaining_balance  # Force depletion in year 10
        else:
            return 0  # No annual RMDs, but must deplete by year 10
    
    # Standard RMD calculation using IRS Uniform Lifetime Table
    life_expectancy_factor = RMD_TABLE.get(current_age)
    rmd_amount = previous_year_balance / life_expectancy_factor
    
    return rmd_amount
```

**RMD Start Ages:**
- Born 1949 or earlier: Age 70.5 (legacy rule)
- Born 1950-1959: Age 72
- Born 1960 or later: Age 73

### 2. IRMAA Calculation System

**Integration:** Uses centralized `tax_csv_loader.py` system
**Data Source:** CSV files with inflation-adjusted thresholds
**Key Function:** `calculate_irmaa_with_inflation(magi, filing_status, year)`

**2025 IRMAA Thresholds:**
- Single: $106K, $133K, $167K, $200K, $500K
- MFJ: $212K, $266K, $334K, $400K, $750K

**Surcharges:** Progressive from $71.90/month to $431.00/month (Part B) + Part D surcharges

### 3. Tax Calculation Engine

**Federal Tax Calculation:**
```python
def _calculate_federal_tax_and_bracket(self, taxable_income):
    tax_loader = get_tax_loader()
    filing_status = self._normalize_filing_status(self.scenario.tax_filing_status)
    tax, bracket_str = tax_loader.calculate_federal_tax(taxable_income, filing_status)
    return tax, bracket_str
```

**Standard Deduction Integration:**
- Uses CSV-based standard deduction values
- Supports custom deductions and blind/dependent adjustments
- Applies proper filing status mappings

### 4. Conversion Impact Calculations

**Pre-retirement Years:**
- Manually calculated when conversion starts before retirement
- Includes conversion amounts in MAGI and taxable income
- Applies Medicare costs if client is 65+
- Proper tax bracket calculations with standard deductions

**Asset Balance Projections:**
```python
# Reduce traditional account by conversion amount
traditional_balance -= conversion_amount

# Add to synthetic Roth account with growth
roth_balance += conversion_amount * (1 + growth_rate) ** years
```

---

## Database Schema Integration

### Scenario Model Fields
**Location:** `/backend/core/models.py`

**Roth Conversion Fields:**
```python
class Scenario(models.Model):
    # ... other fields ...
    roth_conversion_start_year = models.PositiveIntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    roth_conversion_duration = models.PositiveIntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    roth_conversion_annual_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
```

**Database Constraints:**
- 12-digit limit on annual conversion amounts (enforced in UI and backend)
- Proper null handling for optional conversion fields
- Integration with scenario update endpoints

### IncomeSource Model
**Purpose:** Stores asset/investment account data
**Key Field:** `max_to_convert` - stores individual asset conversion amounts
**Relationship:** Many-to-One with Scenario via foreign key

## Identified Issues and Edge Cases

### 1. RMD Behavior After Full Conversion ⚠️

**Issue:** RMDs may still appear after complete account conversion
**Root Cause:** ScenarioProcessor calculates RMDs based on previous year balance, but conversion happens during the same year
**Impact:** Potentially misleading results showing RMDs from empty accounts

**Technical Details:**
- RMD calculation uses `previous_year_balance` from asset
- Conversion reduces balance during current year
- Race condition between RMD calculation and balance reduction

**Potential Solution:**
```python
# In _calculate_rmd method, check for current year conversions
if hasattr(asset, 'conversion_this_year'):
    effective_balance = previous_year_balance - asset.conversion_this_year
    return effective_balance / life_expectancy_factor if effective_balance > 0 else 0
```

### 2. Complex Pre-retirement Year Handling ⚠️

**Issue:** Manual pre-retirement year calculation is complex and error-prone
**Location:** `RothConversionProcessor.process()` lines 576-692 and 776-885
**Complexity:** Duplicate code blocks for baseline and conversion scenarios

**Recommendations:**
- Refactor pre-retirement logic into separate method
- Add comprehensive test coverage for pre-retirement conversions
- Consider extending ScenarioProcessor to handle earlier start years natively

### 3. Asset Type Filtering Evolution 🔄

**Historical Issue:** Frontend previously checked for old asset types (`traditional_401k`, `traditional_ira`)
**Current Status:** Updated to new system (`Qualified`, `Inherited Traditional Spouse`, etc.)
**Location:** `RothConversionTab.vue` asset filtering logic

**Verification Needed:**
- Ensure all asset type references use new nomenclature
- Validate filtering logic covers all convertible types
- Test with various asset combinations

### 4. Database Precision Limits ✅

**Issue:** Annual conversion amounts can exceed 12-digit database limit
**Status:** **RESOLVED** - Frontend and backend validation implemented
**Solution:** Cap amounts at $999,999,999.99 with user warnings
