# Retirement Planning Calculations Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

I've performed an independent verification of the retirement planning calculations using the 2025 tax code. The calculations show **generally accurate tax bracket applications** but reveal **several discrepancies** in the federal tax amounts and some areas needing clarification.

## Key Findings

### ✅ **ACCURATE ELEMENTS**

1. **Tax Bracket Classifications**: The tax brackets (12%, 22%, 24%) are correctly applied for the AGI levels shown
2. **Income Progression Logic**: The income jump at age 75 (2050) from ~$88K to ~$106K correctly reflects RMD requirements
3. **IRMAA Threshold Recognition**: Medicare cost increases align with IRMAA surcharge thresholds
4. **Social Security Taxation Pattern**: The Gross Income to AGI gap suggests proper partial Social Security taxation

### ⚠️ **CALCULATION DISCREPANCIES**

#### Federal Tax Amount Differences
Based on 2025 tax brackets with $15,000 standard deduction (single filer):

| Year | AGI | Expected Tax | User's Tax | Difference | Status |
|------|-----|-------------|------------|------------|---------|
| 2040 | $42,950 | $3,116 | $3,500 | -$384 | ❌ Overstated |
| 2041 | $47,000 | $3,602 | $3,800 | -$198 | ❌ Overstated |
| 2050 | $78,000 | $8,774 | $12,000 | -$3,226 | ❌ **Significantly Overstated** |
| 2055 | $102,000 | $14,054 | $15,000 | -$946 | ❌ Overstated |
| 2057 | $107,000 | $15,154 | $18,000 | -$2,846 | ❌ **Significantly Overstated** |
| 2062 | $139,000 | $22,607 | $25,000 | -$2,393 | ❌ **Significantly Overstated** |

#### Analysis of Tax Calculation Issues

**1. Standard Deduction Application**
- **Expected**: $15,000 standard deduction should reduce taxable income
- **Issue**: User's taxes appear calculated without standard deduction or with a different deduction amount
- **Example**: AGI $42,950 → Taxable $27,950 → Tax $3,116 (vs. user's $3,500)

**2. Progressive Tax Bracket Calculation**
- **Expected**: Progressive calculation across brackets (10% + 12% + 22% portions)
- **Issue**: User's taxes suggest a simplified or different calculation method
- **Example**: $139,000 AGI should yield $22,607 tax (vs. user's $25,000)

## Medicare Cost Analysis

### IRMAA Threshold Verification

The Medicare cost increases appear to align with IRMAA thresholds:

| MAGI Threshold | Part B Surcharge | Part D Surcharge | Total Annual Impact |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| $106,000 | +$71.90/mo | +$13.70/mo | +$1,027/yr |
| $133,000 | +$179.80/mo | +$35.30/mo | +$2,581/yr |
| $167,000 | +$287.80/mo | +$57.00/mo | +$4,138/yr |
| $200,000 | +$396.00/mo | +$78.60/mo | +$5,695/yr |

**✅ Verification**: Large Medicare cost jumps with ℹ️ symbols should correspond to these MAGI thresholds.

## Social Security Taxation Analysis

### Income Gap Analysis

The consistent ~$35K difference between Gross Income and AGI suggests:

**Social Security Taxation Logic**:
- **Gross Income**: Total income including full Social Security benefits
- **AGI**: Includes only the taxable portion of Social Security benefits
- **Gap**: Represents non-taxable portion of Social Security

**Estimated Social Security Benefits**:
Based on the income gap analysis:
- Early retirement years: ~$70,000 annual Social Security benefits
- Later years: ~$46-48,000 annual Social Security benefits (adjusted for inflation)
- **Taxation**: Approximately 50% of benefits appear taxable (above $25K threshold)

## Technical Verification

### 2025 Tax Bracket Verification (Single Filer)
```
10%: $0 - $11,925
12%: $11,925 - $48,475
22%: $48,475 - $103,350
24%: $103,350 - $197,300
```

### Calculated Examples
**AGI $78,000 (2050 scenario)**:
- Taxable Income: $78,000 - $15,000 = $63,000
- Tax Calculation:
  - 10% bracket: $11,925 × 0.10 = $1,193
  - 12% bracket: ($48,475 - $11,925) × 0.12 = $4,386
  - 22% bracket: ($63,000 - $48,475) × 0.22 = $3,196
  - **Total: $8,774** (vs. user's $12,000)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Verify Standard Deduction Application**
   - Confirm $15,000 standard deduction is being applied
   - Check if additional deductions are being used

2. **Review Tax Calculation Method**
   - Ensure progressive tax bracket calculation
   - Verify no double-taxation of Social Security benefits

3. **Validate State Tax Treatment**
   - Confirm if state taxes are included in federal tax amounts
   - Separate state and federal tax calculations if combined

4. **Cross-Check Medicare MAGI Calculations**
   - Verify MAGI = AGI + Tax-Exempt Interest + Foreign Earned Income
   - Confirm IRMAA surcharges match calculated MAGI levels

### System Improvements

1. **Implement Progressive Tax Calculation**
   ```python
   def calculate_federal_tax(agi, filing_status='Single'):
       standard_deduction = 15000  # 2025 single filer
       taxable_income = max(0, agi - standard_deduction)
       # Apply progressive brackets...
   ```

2. **Separate Tax Components**
   - Federal income tax
   - State income tax (if applicable)
   - Social Security tax
   - Medicare tax

3. **IRMAA Validation**
   - Cross-reference MAGI with IRMAA thresholds
   - Validate surcharge calculations

## Conclusion

The retirement planning calculations show **correct tax bracket identification** and **logical income progression**, but have **significant federal tax calculation errors**. The primary issues are:

1. **Tax amounts are overstated by $384-$3,226** across all years
2. **Standard deduction may not be properly applied**
3. **Progressive tax calculation may be simplified or incorrect**

**Recommended Action**: Review the tax calculation engine to ensure proper application of the 2025 tax code with progressive brackets and standard deductions.
