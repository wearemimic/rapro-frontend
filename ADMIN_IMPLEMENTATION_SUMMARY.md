- **Support Statistics**: Resolution rates, response times, satisfaction

#### 7. Navigation Integration
- **Router Setup** (`/frontend/src/router/index.js`): Admin routes with role checking
- **Sidebar Integration** (`/frontend/src/components/Sidebar.vue`): Admin section in navigation
- **Auth Store** (`/frontend/src/stores/auth.js`): Admin role getters and permissions

## üîê Role-Based Access Control

user = CustomUser.objects.get(email='your-email@example.com')
user.is_platform_admin = True
user.admin_role = 'super_admin'
user.save()
```

### 3. Frontend Dependencies
Ensure Chart.js is installed for analytics visualizations:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install chart.js
```

### 4. Environment Variables
No new environment variables required - uses existing Auth0 and database configuration.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Admin role assignment works and is logged
- [ ] User impersonation creates proper audit trails
- [ ] Bulk operations function correctly

### Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Dashboard loads key metrics without errors
- [ ] Charts render correctly with real data
- [ ] System monitoring shows accurate performance data
- [ ] Support tools identify issues correctly

### Audit Logging
- [ ] All admin actions create audit log entries
- [ ] Impersonation sessions are fully tracked
- [ ] Risk scoring works for different action types
- [ ] High-risk actions are flagged appropriately

## üìã Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

Based on the PRD, these features are planned for future phases:
- Advanced user impersonation with session management
- Automated security threat detection
- Advanced billing analytics and revenue forecasting
- Custom admin dashboard widgets
- Bulk communication tools
- Advanced system monitoring with alerting

## üîß Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes added for all major query patterns
- Pagination implemented for large data sets
- Charts use efficient data loading patterns
- Audit logs have automatic cleanup mechanisms

### Security Considerations
- All admin endpoints require authentication and role validation
- Sensitive actions require additional confirmation
- User impersonation has built-in safeguards and logging
- Risk-based alerting for unusual admin activity

### Maintenance Notes
- Audit logs should be periodically archived (6-12 months)
- User activity metrics should be cached for performance
- Chart.js should be kept updated for security
- Admin role assignments should be regularly reviewed
